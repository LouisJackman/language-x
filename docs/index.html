<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>

<p>
Java and C# moved C++ application programmers away from direct memory
management onto managed abstract machines with concurrency, networking,
serialisation, and portability built-in.
</p>

<p>
What about the next language and runtime after Java and .NET? Better distributed
and concurrent programming support would be a good starting point. Null-free
types, ubiquitous immutability, a lack of concrete inheritance, built-in
supervisor trees, and transparently asynchronous IO would acknowledge this era
of computing.
</p>

<p>
Hardware is no longer speeding up exponentially year-on-year and is becoming
increasingly parallel. Performance cannot be discarded out of hand like the rise
of dynamic languages throughout the previous decade.
</p>

<p>
Large semantic changes will likely be rejected by developers if not presented in
a syntax similar to existing languages; like Java took C++'s syntax, the next
language should take Java's.
</p>

<p>
A gap exists between scripting languages and application languages; would enough
type inference and support for features like top-level executable code and
shebangs help bridge the gap to allow both to be done in one language?
</p>

<p>
Strong isolation boundaries at modules and explicitly declared dependent modules
and their full versions are required to evolve large systems over time without
breaking compatibility. Major version changes, according to semantic versioning,
are breaking changes, and should therefore be considered completely different
modules. Non-pinned dependency versions or disallowing the import of multiple
major versions of the same module does not scale in the modern world of software
development.
</p>

<p>
A runtime will be needed for preemptive concurrency and light weight tasks.
Go shows that compromises regarding the tasks' preemptiveness must be made in
the case of native compilation.
</p>

<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="done">Lex.</li>
  <li>Parse.</li>
  <li>Implement the runtime.</li>
  <li>Interpret without any checks.</li>
  <li>Add checks such as types.</li>
  <li>Add optimisations like persistent data structures.</li>
  <li>Compile with bundled runtime.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Look as syntactically similar to Java and C# as possible.</li>
  <li>
    Support mixed-ability teams by not adding footguns or abstractions that do
    not scale; powerful features should have very little action-at-a-distance.
    Computer science concepts are trumped by real world, large-scale software
    engineering concerns.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use null-free static types and increase type-system expressiveness over Java
    and C#.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make interpreter and other components easy to work with; make tool and IDE
    integration as easy as possible. Perhaps an FFI into the final parser and
    compiler and an initial Language Server Protocol implementation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on AOT compilation for ease of distribution, Go- and Rust-style.
    Support interpretation for embedding, quick debugging, and interactive
    development.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use ubiquitous immutability to reduce unnecessary side-effects and coupling;
    invalid states should be unrepresentable.
  </li>
  <li>Allow distributed programming with message-passing.</li>
  <li>Transparently handle asynchronous IO.</li>
  <li>
    Make tasks cheap, preemptive, and killable; tasks should be a useful
    abstraction, not like threads which are a low-level OS-provided feature with
    endless edge cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove or fix error-prone features from Java and C#, like
    assignments-as-expressions, pre and post decrement and increment, nulls,
    concrete inheritance, pervasive mutability, type erasure, statics,
    primitives and autoboxing, default memory sharing across tasks, and in-task
    catchable exceptions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Non-overflowable arithmetic should be default; machine-width arithmetic as
    an opt-in for performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Encourage compile-time metaprogramming over runtime annotation and
    reflection; design it to scale in the large without becoming cryptic.
  </li>
  <li>Be mostly expression-based and with decent pattern matching.</li>
  <li>Guarantee tail-call elimination.
</ul>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<h3 id="details-modules-and-packages">Modules and Packages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Packages live within modules.</li>
  <li>
    Modules are the most coarse encapsulation boundary developers have.
  </li>
  <li>
    Package are for laying out the structure of modules.
  <li>
    There is an implicit <code>main</code> module and <code>main</code> package.
    The implicitness is to reduce boilerplate for single-line programs and
    scripts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Programs must be in a <code>main</code> module and a <code>main</code>
    package, but libraries must have their own unique modules and packages.
  </li>
  <li>Modules, unlike packages, are versioned.</li>
  <li>They declare which packages they depend on.</li>
  <li>
    Only items that are public and all of whose parents are also public are
    exposed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>internal</code> accessibility modifier allows making something
    public to other packages, but only within the module.
  </li>
  <li>
    A different major version of a module is effectively considered a different
    module in practice. In fact, multiple major versions of the same module can
    be required at once. Cross-module aliases can be used to gradually evolve
    major package versions over time without breaking compatibility.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leaving a version number out assumes 0.x. Major version 0 is the only
    version for which breaking changes across minor versions is acceptable.
  </li>
  <li>
    The use of private-by-default accessibility combined with no reflection or
    runtime metadata should give some decent oppertunities for dead-code
    elimination and inter-procedural optimisations within a module.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-accessibility-levels">Accessibility Levels</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Private, internal, and public.</li>
  <li>
    Private is the default, no keyword required.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>internal</code> keyword exposes an item to its parent, but only
    within its module.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>public</code> keyword exposes an item to its parent, available
    from outside the module too.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-items-and-expressions">Items and Expressions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Items declare rigid, static program structure.</li>
  <li>Expressions express computations and are obviously Turing complete.</li>
  <li>
    Items can contain expressions, i.e. a method item containing a method body
    with expressions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Expressions cannot contain items.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-types">Types</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Built-ins and user-defined.</li>
  <li>
    No difference between them from the user's perspective except for some of
    them having literals baked into the language  and built-ins being predefined
    by the compiler and runtime. No Java-like primitive vs object distinction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Final classes and trait-like interfaces. No concrete inheritance or
    abstract classes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Constructors are special; this is done to allow function-style
    instantiations while avoiding things like statics, needing to detach
    constructors from class definitions, or having a more complicated
    initialisation syntax.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>void</code> is an actual type, like <code>()</code> in Haskell.
    Defining a method as returning <code>void</code> is a special-case that
    discards the result of final non-void expression and returns the void value
    instead. Every function returning a value, rather than having "procedures"
    without return values, avoids special-cases when composing functions in
    various ways.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>super</code> is to either disambiguate which interface's method to
    delegate to, or to fallback to the auto-generated constructor in
    user-defined constructors. It does not deal with concrete class inheritance.
  </li>
  <li>Generics like C#, as in no type erasure.</li>
  <li>
    Support higher-kinded types, but keep an eye on projects like Dotty to see
    what type-soundness issues they encounter. Perhaps implement a more
    restricted version of it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only nominal types, no structural types. While it would be nice to mandate
    that all type inference should be derivable from inner expressions outwards
    without going the other way, that isn't possible due to constructs like
    immediately-invoked lambdas or lambdas with parameters being passed as
    a parameter typed as a lambda that takes compatible but more precise types.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once we allow that, there's no reason not to allow LHS type inference to
    flow from the RHS as long as it only flows to declarations within a function
    or method body and does not escape it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sylan is more opionated than most language on how to use type annotations:
    all items should be 100% explicitly typed whereas all declarations scoped to
    a method or function should be 100% implicitly typed. The language will not
    expose edgecases where type annotations are ever actually neccessary in
    method or function bodies (like the "<code>:: Float</code> to disambiguate
    <code>Show</code>" problem of Haskell). This is why numbers have explicit
    type suffixes.
  </li>
  <li>
    This ensures APIs and program structure is rigid and explicitly typed while
    expressions are consise, without boilerplate, and utterly consistent rather
    than making type annotations a matter of taste.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-language-versioning">Language Versioning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Keyword <code>v</code> can start a file to denote the source version.</li>
  <li>Has a version after it, e.g. <code>v1.0</code></li>
  <li>
    If not present, assume to be the latest minor version of the earliest major
    release of the language, i.e. 1.x.
  </li>
  <li>
    Three things are versioned: the source, the tokens, and the AST.
  </li>
  <li>
    A source version pins its tokens version; a tokens version pins its AST
    version. So the versioning between the three isn't neccessarily in lockstep,
    but it is fixed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-methods-and-functions">Methods and Functions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Purposely different from one another; there isn't a UFC mechanism that
    unifies them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Both are fully higher-order. Methods carry around their instances with them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Methods, when passed around as values, are just seen as functions that have
    an instance bundled in their closure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>::method</code> is a shorthand for <code>(o, ...args) ->
    o.method(...args)</code>, where the type of <code>o</code> is inferred from
    the context.
  </li>
  <li>
    As methods and functions are both higher-order, invoked the same way, and
    have the same type when passed around, there is no real loss of
    composibility from being different constructs. They can be composed together
    easily: <code>var printDouble = ::double # ::toString # println</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Literals are matched as is.</li>
  <li>
    Composite types are matched as <code>Type(field1, field2 = match2,
    getterValue)</code>.
  </li>
  <li>Public fields and getters can be used.</li>
  <li>
    An identifier by itself is a shorthand for <code>identifier =
    identifier</code>.
  </li>
  <li>There are no positional matches, only matches by specific names.</li>
  <li>
    For types not overriding the built-in constructor, destructuring should be
    symmetrical with constructing.
  </li>
  <li><code>...</code> can be used to omit the rest of the match.</li>
  <li>
    <code>as</code> can bind part of a match to a name, e.g.
    <code>Account(firstName) as account</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prefixing an identifier with a dot matches its value rather than binding
    against the identifier, e.g: <code>Account(firstName = .enteredFirstName,
    ...)</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-matching-in-switch-and-select">Matching in Switch and Select</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    They both have cases which each match one or more patterns seperated by
    commas.
  </li>
  <li>
    Both have <code>default</code> clauses as a fallback "match all" clause.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>switch</code> is exhaustive: a compiler error happens if not all cases
    are covered.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>select</code> is non-exhaustive, silently throwing away messages that
    don't match either the type or the matching patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>select</code> blocks the current task until someone sends the process
    a message of the specified type with a match. <code>timeout</code> clauses
    are available.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-invocations">Invocations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Methods, functions, classes, and objects can be invoked with
    <code>()</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Invoking a method or a function does as one would expect; invoking a class
    constructs an instance; invoking an object allows non-destructive
    updates.
  </li>
  <li>Arguments can have default values.</li>
  <li>
    Any argument can be invoked as either positional or keyword; it's up to the
    caller.
  </li>
  <li>
    Two special parameter types exist: variadic and variadic entry. The former
    allows an variable amount of arguments, whereas the latter allows a variable
    amount of <code>sylan.lang.Entry</code> arguments with syntactical sugar.
    The latter is primarily for providing a good syntax for constructing map
    types that user-defined types can use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prefixing an argument with a dot is a shortcut for assigning a keyword
    argument from a binding of the same name, e.g.
    <code>Account(.firstName)</code> is <code>Account(firstName =
    firstName)</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Passing <code>_</code> for one or more arguments partially applies the
    invocation, returning a new function with the non-underscore arguments
    evaluated and partially applied to the result. This allows, for example,
    partially-applying a non-destructive object update, partially applying a
    function, or partially-applying the instantiation of a class.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-compile-time-metaprogramming">Compile-time Metaprogramming</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    No <code>constexpr</code>, templating, or <code>static if</code>. Should be
    the same language as runtime.
  </li>
  <li>
    Derive from Lisp and Jai but reduce footguns like Common Lisp automatic
    variable captures.
  </li>
  <li>Do not copy D or C++.</li>
  <li>Will eliminate the need for reflection.</li>
  <li>
    What are the security implications of running arbitrary code from the
    compiler? Surely we should at least ban system side-effects?
  </li>
  <li>
    CL's <code>defmacro</code> is too low-level; a Java-like annotation syntax
    could be used for a more controlled subset, perhaps hygienic macro system a
    la Scheme.
  </li>
  <li>
    Macros can only be invoked against a specific tokens version or an AST
    version. The compiler just won't compile macros designed for a v2 AST when
    invoked against a v3 source.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-runtime-structure-information">Runtime Structure Information</h3>

<ul>
  <li>No reflection.</li>
  <li>No runtime annotations.</li>
  <li>Use compile-time programming instead.</li>
  <li>
    Reduces magic, as compile-time metaprogramming cannot happen at random
    points during a running application unless <code>eval</code> exists.
  </li>
  <li>Improves performance as metaprogramming is done at compile-time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-the-runtime">The Runtime</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It will probably be heavily BEAM-inspired.</li>
  <li>Must do tail call elimination.</li>
  <li>No mutable data except the execution of tasks over time.</li>
  <li>
    Lightweight processes. Immutability means changes can only be sent via
    messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Initial toy implementation to use threads. Real implementation can use
    userland scheduler with remote process support.
  </li>
  <li>To handle remote processes, Tasks need node IDs.</li>
  <li>...and nodes need network addresses or localhost.</li>
  <li>
    Per-task GC in theory; probably global GC in first implementation for
    simplicity. (Perhaps that's OK if only a single task's world gets stopped
    at any time.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Look at leveraging existing GCs via native interop, like Boehm-GC. However,
    they might be unsuitable for many lightweight tasks collecting
    concurrently.
  </li>
  <li>Persistent data structures.</li>
  <li>
    Async IO; use a library like Tokio. OK to block in the prototype, but don't
    add any language features that break compatibility with async in the proper
    version.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-the-build-system">The Build System</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Go-style; just derive information from the source files rather than using
    separate configurations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Strong compile-time metaprogramming can assist here, similar to how Jai
    replaces Makefiles with compile-time profiles.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-interoperability">Interoperability</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Lightweight tasks will be awkward with POSIX/WinNT threads for native
    interop; see Erlang and Go's issues here. Not sure of a better alternative
    if we're using userland stacks and scheduling.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-standard-library">Standard Library</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Standard lib should be modular, like Java 9's JRE. Implementations can
    opt-in to each, similar to C11 features like VLAs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-to-consider">To Consider</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    What happens if a task does multiple selections with different types? Do
    messages of the wrong type get saved to be selected later on, or are messages
    always thrown away if the current blocking select does not support that type?
  </li>
  <li>
    Parameterisable packages, perhaps a less powerful version of ML functors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Matrix operations to implement for user types, even if builtins do not use
    them. See Python 3 for an implementation of this.
  </li>
  <li>
      Subtyping for built in types, like subranges across integers, Ada-style?
  </li>
</ul>
