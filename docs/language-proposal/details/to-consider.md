# To Consider

* Parameterisable packages, perhaps a less powerful version of ML functors.
* Subtyping for built in types, like subranges across integers, Ada-style?
* Reject changes that break backwards compatibility if the major version isn't
  bumped, similar to Elm.
* Replace auto-generated methods with a more consistent `derives`/`deriving`
  approach, a la Rust and Haskell.
